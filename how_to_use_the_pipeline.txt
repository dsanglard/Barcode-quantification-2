FASTQ FILE PROCESSING PIPELINE FOR DEEP MUTATIONAL SCANNING 


AIM: count the occurence of known barcode or tag sequence in a fastq file. This pipeline is meant to be used in case of population studies where we were are interested in knowing the distribution of the population. 


CONTENT: 

1. barcodes.txt

List of barcodes used in the experiment - contains barcode name and sequence.


2. mismatch.sh

To be permissive we can allow more or less barcode mismatches. This script helps determine how many mismatches we can allow without having barcodes aligning with each other.  

parameters to be set:

	- WORDSIZE = 25

	look for 25 consecutive bases [allow 15 mismatches over 40 bases for example]


3. bc_count.sh 

Each barcode sequence is aligned to each read of the FASTQ file using a megablast. The script will output a text file containing the occurrence of each barcode. 

parameters to be set:

	- FASTQ_HEADER = depends on the sequencer used [@TWEETY for MiSEQ - GTF, Lausanne]

	- QFILTER = 1 if we take only the passed filter reads or 0 if we use all the reads

	- export TRIMPOS = 40 and export TRIMSIZE = 100

	get rid of all bases until position 40 and keep the 100 next ones 

	- WORDSIZE = 25	
	 
	look for 25 consecutive bases [allow 15 mismatches over 40 bases for example]


4. batch.sh

This script loops the previous bc_count.sh script through all fastq files saved in folder BC.



HOW TO USE THE PIPELINE


STEP 1: 


Open your terminal


IMPORTANT: set directory to BC folder to use the scripts. For example:

	cd marionpatxot/Desktop/BC/


STEP 2: 


Use script mismatch.sh to determine the WORDSIZE.

	./mismatch.sh INPUT_BC_COLLECTION 

If the number of alignments found is equal to the number of barcodes used then the barcodes do not auto-align and WORDSIZE can be used to count the occurence of each barcode. 

NOTE: You may also choose not to be permissive at all and allow zero mismatches.


STEP 3:


Perform the megablast using the script batch.sh.

	./batch.sh INPUT_BC_COLLECTION FASTQ_HEADER QFILTER TRIMPOS TRIMSIZE WORDSIZE
